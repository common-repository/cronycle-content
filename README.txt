== Description ==

Cronycle’s all-in-one platform helps professionals and teams discover, harvest and share great content. Cronycle makes it easy to (A) identify the most trusted, relevant content topics, influencers and sources; (B) surface the best nuggets of information; and (C) share insights with your audiences to keep them engaged.

With Cronycle, content can be curated from across the web, including: 
 - Industry websites
 - Blogs and Directories
 - Podcasts
 - Videos
 - Alerts (Google News, Bing News, Reddit)
 - Online publications (like Medium)
 - Social feeds (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc)
 - Documents and .PDFs
 - RSS
 - Newsletters
 - and Many More!

Cronycle boards make it easy for curators to highlight, annotate, comment and add summaries to their content prior to publishing. In addition to WordPress, Cronycle allows users to publish their curated content to social media accounts, RSS, subscriber newsletters, and endless other locations using Zapier.

The Cronycle plugin for WordPress enables you to easily publish content to blogs with summaries and tags. To use this plugin, you must first set up a Cronycle account. Create one [here](https://app.cronycle.com/signup).

== Installation ==

Initial setup:
 - Download, install, and activate Cronycle WordPress plugin.
 - Login to your Cronycle account, make sure you have a board (create one if you do not).
 - Turn on WordPress publishing through the “Publish” options near the top right of your selected board. Expand the WordPress option, and click on “set up publishing to WordPress”. Follow the steps to link your Cronycle account to your WordPress using your unique activation code (to add to the Cronycle settings in WordPress). Set up filters and confirm in Cronycle.
 - Pin content to your board (if you are a part of a team, it may require editor approval if you have that setting enabled).

Now, go to the WordPress plugin. New content from your board will appear in a list under the page “Cronycle Content”. From the list, you can preview, edit, publish or hide the content coming from your Cronycle board. Once converted to draft or published, it becomes a “normal” post on your website.

For more detailed installation and usage guidance, [read the tutorial](https://www.cronycle.com/wordpress-plugin/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= content marketing, content insights, content curation, content collaboration, content aggregator, content research, market intelligence =

The Cronycle plugin for WordPress lets you publish content posted to any Cronycle board as a post on your website - whether it's an article, note, tweet or group of content. 

= How do I select the content that appears in the Cronycle plugin for WordPress? =

In Cronycle, go to board publishing settings, switch on WordPress and follow the instructions. This will allow you to install, connect and set up. Once the setup is completed, any content matching your filters will be quickly added to the available content in the Cronycle content section in WordPress, ready for you to review, edit and publish. Read the [detailed tutorial here](https://www.cronycle.com/wordpress-plugin/). 

= What sources can I get content from? =

Cronycle helps you easily discover, harvest and share new content without knowing specific sources. Cronycle aggregates information from millions of sources including RSS, websites, Twitter, newsletters and podcasts. With Cronycle, you can eliminate blindspots and stay ahead of the latest developments and emerging trends.

= Can I import the full content from the source? =

No, for copyright reasons, we think it is fair to cite only a small section of the original content, imported automatically as a quote, and refer to the source to read the full article. However, you can add your own summary and tags on your Cronycle board: they will get published, reflect your point of view, and match your SEO strategy.

= Is it compatible with my page template? =

Yes; the Cronycle plugin for WordPress uses the standard WordPress blog post data points and block formats like paragraph (with inline URL), title, image URL, quote, heading, etc. As a result, it is compatible with blog post tile layouts and page templates.

= Can I use this plugin with a free Cronycle account? =

No, you need an Essentials, Pro or Enterprise account to enable publishing to WordPress from your Cronycle boards.

= Why is no content coming through? =

Content comes from your Cronycle boards to the Cronycle content page supported by the plugin within 30 seconds, but you need to refresh the page on the WordPress side. If content is not showing up, make sure you editor approve the content on the board tile (if you're a part of a team using the editor approval filter) in the publishing setup section (it is the default setting).

= Can I see it in action? =

Yes, view [this tutorial](https://www.cronycle.com/wordpress-plugin/) with screenshots and a video.
